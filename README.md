### Kia Ora! I'm Johanah ðŸ‘‹
My main interests in the field are currently with mobile and front end development roles. However, I am open to explore new roles and welcome any opportunity to learn and grow within the field

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning how to perform risk assessments from given case studies for my Cyber Security class, and how to create a mobile app.

ðŸ”­ At university, I'm currently developing a medication reminder mobile app with my group using React Native and JavaScript for our Mobile Development class. <!-- Here is a sneak peek of some of the screens I've been working on! ADD PIC-->


ðŸ”­ Earlier this year I learnt the fundamentals of User Experience Engineering and how to analyse designs and had the opportunity to create some with my group! Here are some of the screens I worked on!
