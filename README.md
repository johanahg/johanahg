### Kia Ora! I'm Johanah ðŸ‘‹
My main interests in the field are currently with Development and Security.
However, I am open to explore new roles and welcome any opportunity to learn and grow within the field :)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a collaborative project to develop a clone of the 1989 Atari game 'Chip's Challenge', with students from my Software Development class. 

ðŸŒ± At the moment, I'm learning how to program with SQL and JavaScript, and have recently started working collaboratively in group projects!
