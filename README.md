### Kia Ora! I'm Johanah ðŸ‘‹
My main interests in the field are currently with mobile and front end development roles. However, I am open to explore new roles and welcome any opportunity to learn and grow within the field :)

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning how to perform risk assessments from given case studies for my Cyber Security class, and how to create a mobile app using React Native!

ðŸ”­ At university, I'm currently developing a medication reminder mobile app with my group using React Native and JavaScript for our Mobile Development class. Here are the screens I've been working on!

ðŸ”­ Earlier this year I learnt the fundamentals of User Experience Engineering including how to analyse designs, and even had the opportunity to create some designs for a potential financial management app with my group. Here are some of the screens I designed!
